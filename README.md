# KTLT
2023.1, ET2031, I and a friend had a plan of making Sudoku, the OG. If possible, we wanted it to have a seperate UI, other than the Terminal.

# How to play 
What do you mean by this. It is f*king Sudoku. The Vanilla one of course.

# Requirements
- Uses Linux or Windows (OSC for boarder side)
- Have g++, clang++ in their newest version.

# Installation
- For Linux, use your good ol' git clone. Then the following
  '''
  cd <desired folder>/
  g++ -Ofast -pthread ./src/*.cpp -lncursesw -o <gamename>
  '''
- For Windows, git clone is available. But I am still working on the Terminals syntax for this
# Running this junk
- For Linux, just: ./<gamename>
# Instruction
- To be continued
# Demos and bugs
